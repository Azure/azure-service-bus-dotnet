# Microsoft Azure Service Bus Client for .NET

**Please be aware that this library is currently in active development, and is in no way supported by Microsoft**

This is the next generation Service Bus .NET Library that focuses on Queues & Topics. While this is a work in progress, we wanted to work on a public GitHub repo that will allow us to solicit feedback from our customers. Stay tuned!

This library is built using .NET Standard 1.3. For more information on what platforms are supported see [.NET Platforms Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library#net-platforms-support).
